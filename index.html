        <h3><strong class="subheading">BIO</strong> ();</h3>
        <p class="bodyText" > Chris Joubert is an aspiring Software Engineer who started his journey into coding by tinkering with C++ for the <a class="contactLink" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Unreal Engine</a> <br>
            Prior to learning the fundamentals of coding, Chris enjoyed a journey of self discovery throughout his early to late 20s.<br> 
            
            During his early years his main goal in life was to discover a career he would be truly passionate about. <br>
            He lives by the motto that:"<em>If you do what you love for a job, you'll never work a day in your life</em>".
        </p>

        <p class="bodyText"> Some of his past jobs include: 
            <ul> 
                <li>Demolition Technician</li>
                <li>Quality Control inspector for MGL grenade launchers</li>
                <li>Trained extra on a blockbuster film set</li>
                <li>Personal Trainer on-board a cruise ship</li>
                <li>Customer Support Operations Manager working remotely for one of the biggest gaming companies</li>
    
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="bodyText"> Chris discovered a passion for coding while working 3 years in customer support of a leading gaming brand.<br>
            He started to further develop his understanding of code by learning how to develop a game in Python using <a class="contactLink" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.pygame.org/news" >Pygame</a>.<br> 
            However, this only further fuelled his passion for coding and soon he also sign up can completed short courses in Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, C# and even SQL. <br>
            He continues to develop his knowledge of software engineering with <a class="contactLink"  target = "_blank" href = "http://hyperiondev.com/" >HyperionDev</a> and their Software Engineering Bootcamp.<br>
            Chris dreams of someday creating life changing <em>robotic prophetic limbs</em> that will be <strong>just as good</strong>, if not better than the real thing.<br> 
            He hopes to use this to give amputees a second chance at living life to the fullest!

        <h3><strong class="subheading">Current Programming Projects</strong> ();</h3>
            <p class="bodyText"> 
                <a class="contactLink"  target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/OM3G424747/Game-Dev"> Super Space Pirate</a>
                - Super Space Pirate was developed as one of Chris' first games.<br> This project was used as a stepping stone to learn the basics of python with the use of Pygame.<br>
                The game currently still needs to be revisited and refactored. A working demo is also currently available on <a class="contactLink" target = "_blank" href = "https://om3g4-247.itch.io/super-space-pirate">itch.io</a> <br><br>
                <a class="contactLink" target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/OM3G424747/Hangman-Assignment"> Hangman Game</a> 
                - Chris coded Hangman as part of an assignment for Pirple.com before their course material was changed to remove assignments.<br> This project was used to help further develop his knowledge of OOP.<br>
                The code currently still needs to be revisited, refactored and optimized. A working demo is also currently also available on <a class="contactLink" target = "_blank" href = "https://om3g4-247.itch.io/hangman">itch.io</a> <br><br>
                <a class="contactLink" target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/OM3G424747/hyperionDev_CapstoneProjects/tree/main/Level%203%20-%20Capstone%20Project%201"> Project Management System</a>
                - This <em>"Project Management System"</em> was created as part of a series of Capstone Assignments for <a class="contactLink" target = "_blank" href = "http://hyperiondev.com/" >HyperionDev</a> and their Software Engineering Bootcamp.<br> 
                The source code was written using Java and it's Swing framework. The system saves and retrieves Project information to a SQL Database. <br>
                In addition to this the system will also save "Invoices" to a txt file and restrict access only to the person who has access to the SQL root account.<br>
